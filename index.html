            <p>212 Fifth Avenue is a building that bridges the gap of modernity. It is a relevant link between
                centuries, a
                thread of continuity between the industrial and technological revolutions. The building was envisioned
                using
                thoroughly modern concepts; it is an early example of an open plan skyscraper with oversized windows,
                built
                at a time and place in history when the logical formal outcome of that concept was too radical a
                proposition
                for its moment.</p>
